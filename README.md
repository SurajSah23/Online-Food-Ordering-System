I've created a comprehensive online food ordering system with all the requested features. Here's an overview of what I've implemented:

System Architecture
The application follows a modern React architecture with Redux Toolkit for state management:

Frontend: React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
State Management: Redux Toolkit with slices for different domains
Routing: React Router for navigation between pages
UI Components: Custom components with Lucide React icons
Key Features
Menu Management
Display menu items with images, descriptions, and prices
Filter menu by categories
Search functionality for menu items
User Management
User registration and login
Account profile with balance information
Session management with Redux
Shopping Cart
Add items to cart with quantity selection
View and modify cart contents
Calculate total cost
Order Placement
Checkout process with balance verification
Order confirmation with details
Balance deduction upon order placement
Order History
View past orders with details
Order status tracking
Error Handling
Form validation
Insufficient balance checks
Authentication verification
Database Design
The application uses Redux store as a simulated database with the following models:

User:

id, username, password, balance
MenuItem:

id, name, description, price, image, category, available
CartItem:

menuItemId, quantity, name, price
Order:

id, userId, items, totalAmount, status, orderDate, estimatedDeliveryTime
User Flow
User registers/logs in
Browses menu and adds items to cart
Reviews cart and proceeds to checkout
Confirms order and receives confirmation
Can view order history in profile
The application is now running and you can test all these features. You can use the demo accounts (user1/password1 or user2/password2) to log in and explore the system.
